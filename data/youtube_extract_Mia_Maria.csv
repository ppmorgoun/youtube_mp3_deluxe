I do like this helmet but there are a few things that I hope have been fixed seeing as the new 3.0 is coming out soon! 


I may not be able to get the new 3.0 helmet as their financing option is not available to residents of New Zealand big sad :( 


Hopefully I could save up to get it!


I mean feel free to donate like $1 so I can get the new 3.0 Atlas ;)

I am more active on TikTok now that I have moved to a place with slow internet and I mean SLOW like dial up speed haha so bear with! 

I do admit I didn't like what happened in 2020 not only for me but everyone around the world had been affected. Was hard for me to stay mentally positive without a job was a lot more stressful financially but I wasn't the only one. So here are some clip of my last year (the good bits) and lets keep moving forward and have a better 2021!

Here's some fun facts about the island:

Goat Island is named after the goats released by early European seafarers, to provide food for those who became marooned. In 1975 the waters around the island were made New Zealand’s first marine reserve, Cape Rodney–Ōkakari Point Marine Reserve. Since then it has been used for fisheries research and as a training ground for recreational divers.


And this specific 'Goat' island has apparently never had any goats on it lol

This helmet feels really nice around my ears, I have never felt such comfort before! 

Ruroc were super awesome to deal with when it came to shipping even when having a mishap ( They didnt change the price to NZD making it look like it was paid in Pounds, they fixed the issue in a few hours).

I am still shocked at how this can happen in our NZ (And still am). I didnt want to make the usual vlog as this event had been on my mind and I cant stop thinking about it, instead I decided to make a memorial video to show how amazing our New Zealand is. 
We can band together is such a short amount of time with so much support and love. I am truly amazed at how much support there is from all over the nation and around the world. 
This has made stronger as we band together as one. We Are One.

My deepest condolences for Muslim community and for the families and friends lost on March 15th 2019.

Just another adventure to an unknown location that's been left for years!

This mill opened in 1927 and closed in 1996. The farmers who own the property are spending money from their own pocket to keep this place preserved! There is a $10 donation to be let onto the property the man George was kind enough to let me free of charge as I realized there was no cell reception to make a bank transfer and I don't carry cash. If you do want to visit send me an email to miamaria4991@gmail.com and I will let you know where this is. Please if you do visit bring $10 with you to help keep this place intact!
